description: Prepare and validate source-based sticker packs through source intake, scene-contract approval, risk pilots, and bounded art waves (G0-G3). Use when identity, source fidelity, transparent die-cut art, exact optional text, and exhaustive per-sticker review matter; do not use this skill alone to export, release, upload, or publish a pack.

# Sticker Pack Production

Move a sticker pack only through G0-G3: source authority, design contract,
representative pilot, then bounded art waves. The user approves design intent and
character feel; the production team remains responsible for finding technical
and visual defects.

## Hard boundaries

- Preserve supplied sources byte-for-byte and bind every authority file by
  path and SHA-256. A later user correction for a named slot outranks its older
  source; otherwise do not reinterpret the source to improve novelty.
- Treat exact text as data. Record the exact Unicode string or `null`; do not
  ask image generation to render final text. Bind any approved typography
  authority by actual font, renderer/method, treatment, and reference paths and
  SHA-256 values; do not silently substitute a generic approximation.
- Keep these outcomes separate: machine audit, independent human review, and
  user design approval. None implies either of the others.
- Never auto-approve identity, style, source semantics, prop ownership,
  anatomy, occlusion, or text meaning from pixel heuristics.
- Do not edit art, change an approved hash, upload, publish, alter privacy, or
  create a platform release unless the user explicitly puts that action in
  scope. This skill may validate a bounded deterministic-text pilot or preview;
  it does not authorize full composition, export, or release.

## Route by current gate

| Gate | Owner and decision | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|
| G0 source intake | coordinator freezes originals, names, count, order, platform partition, roles, hashes, and authority order | G1 contract work |
| G1 design contract | user approves intended scene/pose/prop/text and allowed differences; recorder freezes one row per slot | G2 pilot production |
| G2 risk pilot | machine preflight first, user judges identity/feel, distinct critic judges defects | only the represented production methods |
| G3 bounded wave | machine audit plus a distinct reviewer dispositions every slot and size | next wave or accepted masters |

Read [references/gates-g0-g3.md](references/gates-g0-g3.md) before planning or
advancing a gate. Read
[references/review-rubric.md](references/review-rubric.md) before selecting a
pilot, briefing a critic, or completing a review CSV.

## Contract and machine evidence

Resolve the external repository root, project root, project revision and three audit commands using [the binding contract](../../contracts/project-binding.md). Start from [templates/pack-contract.example.json](templates/pack-contract.example.json), replacing every example authority path/hash and scene field. Run the bound `contract`, `candidate` and `review-lint` commands from their declared working directory with the contract, masters, fresh output paths and stable implementer identity. Never execute a binding as unchecked shell text.

The available implementation is project-owned: Jaelin's `audit:stickers` npm script at design-projects revision `71d661c14098860b7a374e13043fb084994be8a0`, carried into sticker-projects by the migration mapping. Its command prefix is `npm run --workspace jaelin-sticker-pack audit:stickers --`. This is a provider example, not a generic command for other packs. Other projects must explicitly bind a compatible audit implementation and its version, or report machine validation unavailable. The exit-code and output rules below describe this versioned provider contract; verify compatibility before substituting another provider.

Inputs are read-only. Both output directories must be explicit, absent, and
outside any `release`, `accepted`, or `withdrawn` path component. Keep each run
versioned; never overwrite an earlier evidence directory.

Choose one stable ASCII implementer identity for the candidate and reuse it
unchanged for `review-lint`. Candidate evidence binds that identity. Every CSV
`reviewer` must name a different person or agent; matching reviewer and
implementer identities remain `PENDING` with exit code `5`.

Interpret exit codes literally:

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 0 | valid contract, or complete all-PASS human review |
| 2 | candidate machine failure, or a completed human FAIL |
| 3 | invalid contract or missing/changed source authority |
| 4 | unsafe/existing/unwritable output target |
| 5 | machine checks passed but human review is pending/incomplete |

`candidate` normally returns `5` after a clean audit because it creates an
empty review sheet. Do not translate that into success or failure. Inspect
`audit.json`, then complete the CLI-generated `review-disposition.csv`; the
header-only [template](templates/review-disposition.csv) is a field reference,
not a substitute for the hash-bound generated sheet.

Treat a `review-lint` PASS as structural completeness for the recorded
historical review, not proof that its judgment is correct or that it covers a
mutable current masters tree. Before calling the latest masters accepted,
compare every current master path and SHA-256 with its audit row. See the
evidence-reuse and interruption rules in the gate procedure.

## Art production

For new bitmap art or a coherent figure edit, use the available
`creative-production:produce` workflow and `imagegen`. Keep all candidates in
the same active board when a Creative Production board is used. Preserve the
source authority and exact-content contract; one selectable asset belongs in
each review item, while contact sheets remain supplemental evidence.

Choose pilot slots by risk and production-method coverage, not by slot order.
After G2, generate no more than eight unreviewed slots at a time, with at most
four native-image workers and two total native attempts per slot. Preserve
passing hashes and retry only failed slots.

### Design-preview fast lane

For one to three new stickers, or a small targeted edit, use
`DESIGN-PREVIEW` before full-pack production. Reuse already-frozen references,
freeze the exact scene or edit contract, and keep one concise batch receipt.
For feedback, record one sentence of intent and classify it as `expression`,
`identity`, `action`, or `technical`; then freeze the bounded delta and its
invariants. Ask a follow-up only when that sentence leaves a material choice
unresolved—do not impose a questionnaire.

Treat this intent clarification and the user's design choice as planning, not
execution rework. Once the contract is clear and frozen, separately record
implementation reruns and defects that escaped an earlier gate.

Each native-art asset gets one initial native call; a deterministic text-only
pilot uses zero native image calls. Show the small set after narrow machine
checks and review by someone distinct from the implementer. Review the requested
delta plus credible regressions such as complete anatomy, exact text
absence/presence, framing, border, and alpha; a full-pack audit is not required
for every preview tweak. Do not auto-loop after a failure.

Record user approval immediately against the exact current path and SHA-256 in
one current-authority index. Replace its current pointer when authority changes
instead of accumulating contradictory status headers; keep superseded detail
as history. A later user aesthetic choice governs the new bounded candidate and
is not vetoed by an older reference complaint outside the newly frozen scope.

`DESIGN-PREVIEW` never bypasses production gates. A machine failure remains a
clearly labeled non-production preview. Before scaling beyond the small preview,
one representative candidate must prove genuine alpha and pass review at the
intended platform sizes; failure stops full-pack generation and export.

### Deterministic-text pilot

For a text-only pilot, freeze the exact base-art path/hash, Unicode, font-file
path/hash, renderer or composition-method path/hash, style values, placement,
and approved visual examples. Reuse those authorities directly; a same-category
font or a configuration that merely names the style is not equivalent.

Render text as a separate overlay. Bind its actual nonzero-alpha bounds and
prove that decoded base pixels outside that overlay are unchanged. The reviewer
must inspect the actual rendered glyphs, exact case/punctuation,
contract-required outline or halo (white only when specified), placement, and
overlap at native and relevant small sizes on the intended surfaces.
Configuration inspection alone cannot pass typography.

One production owner may reuse the frozen context for the bounded composition;
a distinct reviewer reuses the same context for focused text and preservation
checks. Do not repeat a full-pack audit when only the overlay changed. Keep alpha
and platform-size production gates intact: baked checkerboard pixels remain a
failure even when the text pilot itself looks correct.

When unchanged source already has the required intent approval, use two planned
user checkpoints as a practical target: the scene/pilot checkpoint and the full
composed-pack checkpoint, with exceptions for real design choices. This does not
waive G1 or G2 approval, and systematic machine and human QA stays with the
production team.

If two or more slots share a failure, stop the wave and reopen the common
identity/style/prompt/method contract. Do not spend isolated retries or widen
local masks to hide a shared defect. Anatomy, pose, scene, or global identity
repairs require a coherent whole-figure edit or regeneration.

Measure, without promising, generation time versus raw total elapsed time,
attempts, adopted candidates, user interventions, post-contract execution
rework, and defects found after the gate that should have caught them. Keep
clarification/design-decision time separate from rework.

## Stop conditions

Stop at the earliest affected gate when source hashes change, a contract row is
ambiguous, a production method lacks a representative pilot, machine audit
fails, review rows are incomplete, a distinct reviewer is unavailable, or
identity/anatomy/semantics are disputed. Return only the unresolved design
choice to the user; do not make the user search the pack for defects.
